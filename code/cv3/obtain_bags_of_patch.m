function imageFeatures = obtain_bags_of_patch(image_paths, vocab, patch_size, patch_shift)

% image_paths is an N x 1 cell array of strings where each string is an
% image path on the file system.

% This function assumes that 'vocab.mat' exists and contains an 64 x N
% matrix 'vocab' where each column is a kmeans centroid or visual word. This
% matrix is saved to disk rather than passed in a parameter to avoid
% recomputing the vocabulary every time at significant expense.

% image_feats is an N x d matrix, where d is the dimensionality of the
% feature representation. In this case, d will equal the number of clusters
% or equivalently the number of entries in each image's histogram.

% You will want to construct patch features here in the same way you
% did in build_vocabulary.m (except for possibly changing the sampling
% rate) and then assign each local feature to its nearest cluster center
% and build a histogram indicating how many times each cluster was used.
% Don't forget to normalize the histogram, or else a larger image with more
% patch features will look very different from a smaller version of the same
% image.

% vocab size is 64*D
% 64 is the length of patch feature
% D is the K/clusters of k-means/size of visual word/size of vocabulary
[~, D] = size(vocab);

% how many pixel we move after taking the patch
shift = patch_shift;

% extract patch features for all the given images
N = size(image_paths, 1);

% the required return
imageFeatures = zeros(N,D);

            % note that reshape() concatenate matrix columns
            % and we want to concatenate matrix rows, that's why

    % then normalize this histogram

    img_histo = zeros(1, D);
    Q = size(patch_feats, 2);

        % for each local feature, get the distances to the centroids
        for k=1:D
            distances(k) = vl_alldist2(patch_feats(:,j), vocab(:,k), 'l1');
        end
        % then get the index of the nearest centroid (i.e. nearest distance)
        [~, index] = ismember(min(distances), distances);

        img_histo(index) = img_histo(index) + 1;
    end
    % normalize the histogram, this is
    % the wrong way: img_histo = img_histo ./ sum(img_histo)
